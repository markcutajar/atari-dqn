# Atari DQN

This project aims to illustrate how to create an Atari agent based on [Mnih et al.'s paper Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236) to play the Atari game of Enduro.

Requirements:
* Python 3.8
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* Cuda (Optional, Desirable)
* [OpenAI Atari Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari)
* Other packages in requirements.txt

This follows OO best practices to have a class for the agent, network and memory which communicate with each other. 
More information regarding the setup, how to train and expected results can be found in the accompanying article here.
